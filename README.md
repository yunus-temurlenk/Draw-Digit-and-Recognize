# Draw-Digit-and-Recognize
This project contains many topics inside. Please check the video link below for details



This is a new project I have started. It will include many topics and tools inside such as deep learning, multilayer perceptrons, c++, qt, qml, opencv. I am plannig to have a gui at the end, I will be able to draw any digit inside a paint area in the gui. I will click to the analyze button and it will tell me the digit. Backend will have a model and it will analyze the image. Also we will train this model by using mnist dataset which includes 60.000 handwritten digit images. We are gonna use Multilayer perceptrons for training. All details will be inside the videos.
